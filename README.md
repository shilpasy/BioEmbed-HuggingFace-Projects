# BioEmbed-HuggingFace-Projects
WIP
1. Welcome to the 1st section of BioEmbed-HuggingFace-Projects, a simple demonstration of using Hugging Face's transformers to cluster protein sequences.
   I hope this serves as an informative and inspiring introduction to the exciting world of Hugging Face, protein analysis, and embeddings in the context of bioinformatics.
